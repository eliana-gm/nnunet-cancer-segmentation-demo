# nnU-Net Installation Guide

This project depends on the [nnU-Net v2](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) framework for medical image segmentation.

nnU-Net is a standalone, self-configuring deep learning pipeline that handles preprocessing, training, and inference. This repository assumes you have nnU-Net installed locally, but does not include it directly.

## ðŸ›  Installation Instructions

To install `nnU-Net` (v2) and make it available to the CLI:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet.git
cd nnUNet
pip install -e .
````

> You must use the `-e` flag so that `nnUNetv2_*` CLI commands are available globally.

---

### 2. Install PyTorch

If you don't already have it:

--> [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

Pick your OS, CUDA version, and install command.

Example:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

---

### 3. Environment Variables

The training script in this repo (`train_unet.py`) automatically sets these, but you can also configure them globally:

```bash
export nnUNet_raw_data_base="/absolute/path/to/nnUNet_raw"
export nnUNet_preprocessed="/absolute/path/to/nnUNet_preprocessed"
export RESULTS_FOLDER="/absolute/path/to/nnUNet_results"
```

These paths are required by nnU-Net for its pipeline to function correctly.

---

### 4. Test Your Setup

You should be able to run:

```bash
nnUNetv2_print_available_pretrained_models
```

This confirms the install works.
